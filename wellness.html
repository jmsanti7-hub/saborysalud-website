      <h3>Mini Reset: Breathe, Move, Reset</h3>
      <p>
        This short video is meant to feel like a reset — a moment to breathe,
        reconnect with your body, and move gently. Use it on a lunch break,
        between classes, or whenever you feel your energy dipping.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember: wellness doesn’t have to be extreme to be effective.
        A few minutes of intentional movement and deep breathing can shift
        how you feel for the rest of the day.

    <h3>Nutrition</h3>
    <p>
      Instead of strict rules, we focus on building plates that feel satisfying
      and nourishing. Think: protein for strength, colorful plants for vitamins,
      and culturally familiar carbs that give you energy.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Movement</h3>
    <p>
      Movement should support your life, not punish your body. Walking, lifting,
      dancing, stretching — they all count. Choose activities that you enjoy and
      that fit your current season of life.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h3>Mental Wellness</h3>
    <p>
      We honor rest, boundaries, and emotional health. Progress isn’t ruined by
      one meal, one day, or one setback. Gentle discipline means showing up for
      yourself with both compassion and consistency.
